## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Add optional TopoFit mid-surface normals and flat cortical patches, matching OpenRecon's atlas eligibility, geodesic search, plane-fit criteria and local ribbon geometry. Export native-grid patch-and-normal QC, individual patch surfaces, paired geometry JSON, normals CSV and measurements; support hemisphere, radius, count, quality and native-grid ROI settings. Pin the fsaverage atlas on Hugging Face. Compare the geometry with OpenRecon on both full-resolution validation hemispheres.

  Keep anatomical surfaces in 3-Plane view and give registration sphere files the FreeSurfer parser extension for display. Remove the repeated sidebar warning and single-option contrast selector. Suppress consecutive duplicate technical-log messages across apps, including QSMbly and CALMaR, and report model-download progress when its percentage changes.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- Apply the shared design system and the registry-driven About and Cite dialogs. Every app now states that it is developed and hosted by the Neurodesk team, lists the packages under the hood, names the lightning.org ecosystem, and cites one paper per implemented method plus the Neurodesk platform paper. SynthSR, SYNcro, Deface, BrowserQC and NiiMath use the shared workspace vocabulary (compact sections, one scan picker, shared toolbar, status bar and dialogs).
